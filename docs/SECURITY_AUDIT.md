# Mann Li Method - Security Audit Checklist

## Overview
This checklist provides a framework for conducting a security audit of the Mann Li Method smart contracts.

## Access Control
- [ ] Verify all sensitive functions have appropriate role-based access control
- [ ] Verify role assignments are properly managed
- [ ] Verify role revocation works correctly
- [ ] Verify DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can manage all other roles

## Input Validation
- [ ] Verify all function inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Verify boundary conditions are handled correctly
- [ ] Verify zero address checks are in place
- [ ] Verify amount validations are in place

## Arithmetic
- [ ] Verify all arithmetic operations are safe from overflow/underflow
- [ ] Verify rate calculations are accurate
- [ ] Verify percentage calculations use the correct denominator

## Reentrancy
- [ ] Verify all external calls are protected against reentrancy
- [ ] Verify state changes happen before external calls
- [ ] Verify the nonReentrant modifier is used where appropriate

## Rate Limiting
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is implemented for sensitive operations
- [ ] Verify rate limits are appropriate for the operation
- [ ] Verify rate limiting cannot be bypassed

## Event Emissions
- [ ] Verify all state-changing functions emit appropriate events
- [ ] Verify events include all relevant parameters
- [ ] Verify indexed parameters are used appropriately

## Error Handling
- [ ] Verify all error conditions are properly handled
- [ ] Verify error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Verify custom errors are used where appropriate

## Gas Optimization
- [ ] Verify functions are optimized for gas usage
- [ ] Verify storage patterns are efficient
- [ ] Verify loops are bounded

## Business Logic
- [ ] Verify bond issuance logic is correct
- [ ] Verify coupon payment logic is correct
- [ ] Verify maturity claiming logic is correct
- [ ] Verify reinvestment logic is correct
- [ ] Verify contingency reserve logic is correct

## Upgradeability
- [ ] Verify contracts are not upgradeable (by design)
- [ ] Verify any future upgrade paths are secure

## External Dependencies
- [ ] Verify OpenZeppelin contracts are used correctly
- [ ] Verify OpenZeppelin contracts are up to date

## Testing
- [ ] Verify all functions have unit tests
- [ ] Verify edge cases are tested
- [ ] Verify failure cases are tested
- [ ] Verify test coverage is adequate
